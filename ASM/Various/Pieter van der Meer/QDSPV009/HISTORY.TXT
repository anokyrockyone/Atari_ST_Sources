v0.07, June 26th 1998:

* ASCII in instructions and data is now supported!
* CMPM is now assembled ok. Previously, it assembled to EOR.
* End of sourcefile is now always recognized. In v0.06 the program needed
  an 'END'-command.
* Operand checking for many modes implemented. For example 'ABS X' would
  have assembled to 'ABS A', but now this is considered an error.
* More checks for conform Nx implemented.
* Support for 'LIST' and 'NOLIST' commands added, but not implemented.
* TTP runs completely in usermode for better behaviour under multitasking
  OSes.
* Now waits decently for a keypress on exit. :)

v0.07a, June 29th 1998:

* Some optimisations.

v0.08, August 21st 1998:

* NORM instruction was assembled incorrectly. Fixed now.
* Checks for illegal parallel-instructions with full 24bit-instructions
  combinations.
* rx/nx pipeline clash checking!
* '-l' option caused a LODfile to be output even if errors had occurred.
  This LOD was mosty corrupt. Fixed now!
* Shows 'usage'-information when executed with false parameters.

v0.09: September 12th 1998:

* Overall 20% faster assembly, through optimisation for common commands.
* DSM command included for cyclic buffers. The current implementation is
  not completely memory efficient, but at least it works.
* Bugs in MOVEP, JCLR/JS(S)ET and MOVE commands all concerning the usage
  of ">" and "<". Removed now.
