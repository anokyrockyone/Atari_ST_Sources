PMMUPATCH 2.01 -- New version (Updated November 13, 1991)

 First, this utility is freeware. You are granted the right to use either
the program or the source code. If you want to register, try to send a
postcard to the address at the end of this file.
 
  The program uses the PMMU to map the 32 bit address of the 68030 into
the smaller and standard address range of the 68000, i.e. 24 bits. This
should help with programs that use the upper byte of pointers to store
extra information (e.g. all GFA written programs). A new improvement
remaps also the area $fc0000-$feffff into $e00000-$e2ffff ; this could
be useful with programs that attempt to read directly the ROM (often to
get TOS version). 

 However, this is *NOT* a miraculous masterpiece, so *DO NOT* expect any
program to work perfectly well. You will surely get problems if you have
TT Ram, for TT Ram is installed above the standard 16 Mb. This could lead
to partial overlap between ST and TT Ram ; in such a case, only the ST Ram
will be accessed. Thus, don't use this patch with programs which use TT Ram
(Such as TC 2.03 or Pure C) : you have a very high probability to crash
the system ; anyway, such programs are written correctly and do not need
the patch to execute correctly.

 I have not made many extensive tests on programs known to crash ; if you
have a file that bombed before, but works fine with the patch, please
could you send me the name of the program ? That would help me supply with
a newer release of the patch a list of corrected programs.

 The next version will provide a hot-key to dynamically switch between the
patched MMU configuration and the standard one, to improve compatibility
with TT Ram using utilities. This should be released soon.
