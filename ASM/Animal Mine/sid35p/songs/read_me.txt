	Here are THREE blippblopp musics made by Scavenger of Synergy.
	
	LEIF.MUS     is from Electras screen in Punish Your Machine Demo.
	DBA6.MUS     is from Synergys intro for DBA maggie 6.
	TCC_INVI.MUS is from Electras invitation intro for TCC partys.
	        .TVS stands for The Voice Set, if you didn't know that.

	I haven't seen no other blippblopps made by Scavenger, but if I
        saw them somewhere I'll hack them and upload them.
	That's only because Scavenger makes the BEST blippblopps on ST.
	So therefore peoples should use them.

	The reason why here's no player for the musics is because I've an
	very old player for them which I got directly from BAT in MegaLeif
	Convention 1992. It doesn't support these newer musics made by
	Scavenger. It messes up with drums. 

	The current player that Synergy uses is in DBA maggie 6 intro so go
	ahead and hack it out. I don't want to do it, because we DON'T rip
	other peoples code. Or then you can contact Synergy and ask for the
	player.       

	I guess you people want to know what Aggression is doing currently.
	We're working on the BrainDamage demo which is made in association
	with 7th Son of Kruz (coder responsible for Beyond the Essential
	Existence Demo by Kruz). This demo will MAYBE be released at the 
	TCC party in Gothenbourg/Sweden. If it's not finished or we're not
	satisfied with it, it won't be released at the party. We don't want
	to make it like we did Overdose which was finished in a big hurry 
	at the MegaLeif convention 5 minutes before deadline.

	Also there is coming a music demo which contains fantastic modules
	made by Teque. Only thing that is missing is the bootblock code.
	So it's only matter of a time when it's released.
