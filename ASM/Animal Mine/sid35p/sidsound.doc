Document for the SIDSOUND DESIGNER v.2.42
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Editor runs in low resolution only !!!
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To use the editor, you can click onto the INFO button in the 
upper right edge...
This will describe the most important things for you, but to
add a few things, I (M.C.) typed this little doc:

As you perhaps already noticed, you're now allowed to give the
player a special command (e.g. for SID or for general things)
This means, you can use the SAMPLE Note for commands.
Very important to be mentioned, is that it is to be presumed, you have
the digi-channle (channle A) on, when you will give the player any
command, otherwise the command will be ignore !!!
(This is only important for the editor, the included replay file won't
have any problems with this)

There are two types of commands, the first one is for the SID Voice only
you can set different waveforms for the SID, set a very special voice
distortion onto the SID and a few other things...
But also here, it is important to set the digi-channle on, when editing
these commands. The Sample-Note which includes the command, will be
played too, so that you won't have any gap in your song...
Another type of command is the speed of the replay...
This can be done by setting the Sample number to $f and giving the 
replay speed into the INFO-Byte at the sample note, the following
part of the song will be played with your previously set replay speed !!!

Another important thing :
All SID-Commands, you have set, will be activated, when editing a new
instrument or editing the song...
You can reset them with an 8 at the info-byte...

Onto the disk you will find a tool called SAMCONVERTER, well to my opinion
it is very useful, because you are able to convert any PRO-Noise-or SOUND-
Tracker Sample downto SIDSOUND DESIGNER Samples:

 1- Load an AMIGA Sample
 2- Convert AMIGA to ST
 3- Listen to the Sample
 4- Save sample
 
Note: The replayer will use the TIMER A for SID Voice and
                                TIMER D for Digireplay
                                
The built-in-SID-Spektrum shows you how the TIMER A is used (SID) ...

I (M.C.) hope, this little document will be enough to create fabolous songs
