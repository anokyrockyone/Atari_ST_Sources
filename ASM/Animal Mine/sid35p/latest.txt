Hello, it's MC typing ! 
Here you've got a pre-release of SIDSOUND Designer v3.5 (!!) 
the one with 5 channles of Chip and STE-DMA Sound (soon)...
I would like to ask you to test this version on your computer
and giving me a bug-report (if there is any, in general there shouldn't
be any, but ...) via EMail (MC) This version works on FALCON, too 


Bugs that were killed lately:

- 4 MB Fix installed (no crash when detecting a 4mb machine)
- mouse handling system almost re-written so that there shouldn't any probs.
- file-handler re-written
- resolution switch (lowres/midres) works fine now
- no graphx-bullshit on screen after loading a wrong file

-------------------

Improvements on PRE-RELEASE v3.5

- 3rd SIDvoice should work 
- Instrument editor got a new function on :
    WAVE FX = $10
    which means that this instrument will be played two times in one vbl
    that gives a nice effect (but hear it yourself)
- STE DMA Sound is planned and the menu is already included !
  My new routs already do 5 voices (but they will be released on final ver.)
- A clock has been included to check out how long your tune is
- Much more improved SID-Spectrum Analyzer in the upper left screen
-------------------

Okay folks that was almost all
       
             if there are any bugs that appeared on YOUR machine,
                then PLEASE tell me ...
                 (leave me a EMail or so)
                 

				Okay, 
				  bye bye 
				     from MC of ANIMAL MINE
				     

P.S.: The included song has been ripped by me from the FLIP-O-DEMO 
      it is a yet unreleased song by SCAVENGER of SYNERGY (except 
      in FLIP-O-DEMO intro but there it is played only a 1/3 time at all)
