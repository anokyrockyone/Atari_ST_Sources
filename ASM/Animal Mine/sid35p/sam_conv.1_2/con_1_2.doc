Sample Converter.
-----------------

       Very quick instructions...

       Select 1,2,3 or 4 for the various convertions, with 
options 3 and 4 you will be asked for a pathname and extender, 
YOU MUST ENTER THE DRIVE NAME X:\ (X being the drive you wish 
to work from) AND THEN THE EXTENDER eg *.SPL
       This version doesn't really like working with folders, 
so keep the convertion in the root directory.

PREVIEW SAMPLE
--------------
       It may be neccesary to listen to your samples BEFORE you 
convert them. Press P in the main menu to toggle the preview 
mode on/off. When on, the converter will load a sample and then 
play it back. It will then ask you if you wish to convert the 
sample, press Y or N, if you don't select the sample to be 
converted the program will skip onto the next sample.
       Turning this function on without having selected an 
output device will automatically select internal soundchip.

OUTPUT
------
       This option allows you to listen to the samples as they 
are converted. * NOTE * The output sound is the content of the 
buffer, Amiga format samples will sound distorted due to the 
difference in formats. Output sound is available through a 
variety of devices, Pressing O will flick through the various 
devices as well as turning the function off. Output is 
available through the Monster Sound Cartridge, be sure to 
selected the correct position for the switch on your cartridge.

MUSIC
-----
       The music can be disabled by selecting an output device.
