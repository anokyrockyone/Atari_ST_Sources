This little utility allows  you  to  display  files  grabbed  with the Reservoir
Ripper. The unfortunate thing about .RIP files  is that no art package will load
them and no picture displayer will  display  them  so  until you have compiled a
Maggie issue, you can't see what they look like.

This problem is rememedied with this displayer.

To displayer a picture, simply drag the file onto RIP_VIEW.PRG

You can also install RIP_VIEW.PRG  with  document  type  "RIP". Now whenever you
click on a .RIP file it will be automatically displayed.

The viewer uses dynamic memory allocation and will also depack files packed with
PACK-ICE, as well as handling unpacked pictures.

Have fun rippin' and viewin'!
