                             RIPPER v2.0
                             ===========

I've updated the "Reservoir  Ripper"  so  that  it  now takes over the
Vector Base Register. This jump through  all the old vectors making it
transparent to the currently running  application. This will work with
all programs, except ones that change  the VBR (DNT-Crew stuff, Relics
by Black Lotus).

All you really need to do is put on the VBL ripper (F5).

I will be making changes to the RIP file format soon and also add some
more options  to  the  ripper  for  setting  the  palette  so  you can
differentiate between st/falcon palettes.  Also  the option to display
info in hex and fixed set screen  routines. There will be an option to
toggle VBR mode on/off.

The screen displayer is  more  stable,  so  you  can now see interlace
stuff, but some stuff will mess up.

Chris just called today and says  the  vector  screen messes up on his
monitor - it is probably the resolution  he is starting it from. Can I
recommend starting the ripper from ST medium!
