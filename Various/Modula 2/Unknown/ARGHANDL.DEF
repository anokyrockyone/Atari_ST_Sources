(* This module allows TDI Modula-2/ST programs access to command
   line arguments. To work correctly it must be initialised before any
   Module which overwrites the default Disk Transfer Area (which is where
   TOS puts the command line args). Obviously, the safest bet is to put this
   module first in the IMPORT list. Arghandler copies the command args to
   a safe place for use by the client module. *)
