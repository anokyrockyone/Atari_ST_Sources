This is version 2.1 of the Frankenstein Cross assemblers - a slightly 
modified version of V2.0 by Mark Zenier, which was posted on USENET 
some time ago. This version was modified for the ST and the character 
tables were changed to allow 256-character codetables - this is 
useful when you want to get umlauts or other accent characters on a 
microcomputer with a LCD display.

I have managed to find a HP machine which had the nroff -mm macro 
package installed, so I formatted all doc files with nroff. This 
archive contains two versions of all files: a plain version which 
should work on all printers (name.lp) and a version which was 
formatted for HP PCL3 (for HP Laser / HP Deskjet printers). In both 
cases, you may have to set the correct page length at your printer.

The online man pages for the different assemblers are provided in DVI 
and plain ASCII format.

This assember package is in the public domain - feel free to copy it.
