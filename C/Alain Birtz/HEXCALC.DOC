    To install the Calculator as a desk accessory,  rename "BICALCL.ACC" to 
"DESK3.ACC" on the TOS disk and reset. Now click  on the "Calculator" item 
in the Desk menu, and the calculator window will appear (it can be moved, 
closed or topped like the control panel).

   The calculator can operate in hexadeciamal or decimal mode, and will
convert numbers when switching between the two modes. (There are also 
limited binary and octal display functions while in decimal mode.)

   The keys:
	
	"|" is the logical 'or' operator
	"&" is the logical 'and' operator
	"o" dispaly in octal
	"b" display in binary (last 8 bits)
	"!" is the factorial operator
	"+/-" changes the sign
	"." is the decimal dot
	"%" is the percent operator

   The calculator will do mathematical operations in integer, except if one 
or both operands is expressed in decimal format (with one or two digits 
after the decimal point). For example: 9/4 gives 2 as a result (fractional 
part is truncated) but 9.00/4 or 9/4.0 will give 2.25.

   the calculator is limited to 8 digits in hexadecimal mode and 9 digits 
in decimal mode (including digit after decimal point). WARNING: Errors will 
not be displayed, so stay within the 8 digit restriction.
