Place this program in your AUTO folder, and provided your DeskJet is
online before you boot the ST and this program runs, the DeskJet will
be set to Draft mode. If the DeskJet isn't online, the program will
inform you.

DeskJet Booter will also display a list of the enabled disk drives, and
it will give you some information on your ST's memory. The "free memory"
is the size of the largest free block, and the "system memory" is the
total memory less any consumed by RAM disks, printer spoolers, etc. that
run before this program.

The admittedly trivial Mark Williams C source is included. To edit the
source code, you'll need an editor such as Tempus that can display the
ESC character.

Enjoy, and may you never again have to abort a printout because you
forgot to manually switch to draft mode! (why didn't HP include a
_hardware_ switch for this?)
